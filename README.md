### Progressive Web App (PWA)

The Document Generation API is also available as a Progressive Web App (PWA), which provides several benefits:

1. **Offline Functionality**: Basic features are available even when offline
2. **Installable**: Can be installed on desktop and mobile devices
3. **App-like Experience**: Runs in a standalone window without browser UI
4. **Automatic Updates**: Always uses the latest version
5. **Responsive Design**: Works on any device size
6. **Dark/Light Theme**: Automatically adapts to system preferences
